# articles

Abysmal as I am at organising bookmarks in browsers and keeping a list of articles I'd like to come back to,
this repository will hopefully help me to maintain a log of anything I've enjoyed reading on the web.

## tags

I'll try to consistently tag articles with various themes that crop up, in order to offer some helpful search prompts when the title or author escapes me.

- organisation_design
- work_capacity
- contention
- queue_theory
